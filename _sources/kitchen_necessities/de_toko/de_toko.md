De toko
=============

## Intro
De toko is the Dutch name for your good old Asian grocer. Something called colonialism caused the Netherlands to be a melting pot of different cultures. Therefore the term Asian grocer only scratches the surface. For me personally, it is more like a non-European grocer. Even though I do support going to any arbitrary 'toko' us Dutchies have been blessed with a franchise supermarket that has it all: the Amazing Oriental!
