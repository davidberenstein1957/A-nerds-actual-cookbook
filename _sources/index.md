As to why?
============================

**Why nerd🤓?**
I love cooking up some good food and I feel I can be as creative when cooking up some code. Yes I code, so I am a nerd.

**Why cooking🍳?**
As someone who loves cooking I have had the luck to grow up in a multi-culture household (Dutch and Surinam). In addition, I spend an exchange semester in the country with the most michelin star restaurant in the World: Japan.

**Why cookbook📕?**
I love cooking for friends and I have noticed that they keep asking me for recipes. Everytime this happened I would half-heartedly try to write them down on my mobile phone and send them via chat. So why not avoid the effort of mindless annoying task and bundle the recipes and give them a nice play on the interwebs.

**How to appreciate?**
Maybe you can do one of two things? Buy me a beer or invite me to dinner sometime.
