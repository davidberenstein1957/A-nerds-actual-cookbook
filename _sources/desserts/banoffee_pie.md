## Ingredients

- 4 ripe bananas
- 2 cans of condensed milk (400ml)
- unsalted butter (200 grams)
- digestive cookis (400 grams)
- whipped cream (1 can)

## Recipe

1. Put the two cans with condensed milk in slowly boiling water for 2.5 hrs. Make sure they are fully submerged. **Let them cool completely afterwards** because boiling caramel will spill out when opening.
2. Finely crush the cookies by using a food processor or by smashing them after placing them in the tea towel.
3. Slowly melt the butter in a baking pan. After the butter is melted, kill the heath and add the cookie crumbles. Mix the cookies and butter together.
4. Press the cookie-butter mixture into the sides and bottom of the pie tin. The surface should be smooth but may still be uneven.
