De toko
=============

## Intro
De toko is the Dutch name for your good old Asian grocer. Something called colonialism caused the Netherlands to be a melting pot of different cultures. Therefore the term Asian grocer only scratches the surface. For me personally, it is more like a non-European grocer. Even though I do support going to any arbitrary 'toko' us Dutchies have been blessed with a franchise supermarket that has it all: the Amazing Oriental!

## Why the hell should you go to the toko?!
- authentic ingredients
- way better tofu
- out of your comfort zone
- cheaper than Dutch supermarkets

## What to buy?
I shall try to divide most ingredients by their cuisine and try to link them directly with actual recipes, however, some categories deserve a section of their own because they transcend geographic boundaries.
