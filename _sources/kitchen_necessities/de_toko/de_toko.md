De toko
=============

## Intro
De toko is the Dutch name for your good old neighbourhood Asian grocer. Something called colonialism caused the Netherlands to be a melting pot of different cultures. Therefore the term Asian grocer extend can be extended non-European grocer in my opinion. Even though I do support going to any arbitrary 'toko' we have been blessed with a franchise supermarket that has it all: the Amazing Oriental.
