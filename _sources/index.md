As to why?
============================

**Why nerd?** I love cooking up some good food and I feel I can be as creative when cooking up some code. Take a look at my actual [coding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-berenstein-1bab11105/).

**Why cooking?** As someone who loves cooking I have had the luck to grow up in a multi-culture household. In addition, I spend an exchange semester in the country with the most michelin star restaurant in the World: Japan.

**Why cookbook?** I love cooking for friends and I have noticed that they keep asking me for recipes. Everytime this happened I would half-heartedly try to write them down on my mobile phone over and over again. So, why not bundle them and give them a nice play on the interwebs.
