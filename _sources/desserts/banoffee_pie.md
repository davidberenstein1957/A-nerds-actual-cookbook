## Ingredients

- 4 Ripe Bananas
- 2 Cans of Condensed Milk (400ml)
- Unsalted Butter (200 grams)
- Digestive Cookies (400 grams)
- Whipped Cream (1 can)
- Cocoa Powder

## Recipe

1. Put the two cans with condensed milk in slowly boiling water for 2.5 hrs. Make sure they are fully submerged. **Let them cool completely afterwards** because boiling caramel/[dulche de leche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche) will squirt out when opening.

After 2.5 hours.

2. Finely crush the cookies by using a food processor or by smashing them after placing them in the tea towel.
3. Slowly melt the butter in a baking pan. After the butter is melted, kill the heath and add the cookie crumbles. Mix the cookies and butter together.
4. Press the cookie-butter mixture into the sides and bottom of the pie tin. The surface should be smooth but may still be a bit uneven. Let the crust pie bottom cool in the crust to harden the butter. **If you have some crust left, make a cute little pie as shown above.**
5. Cut the bananas in thin slices and divide them over the hardened crust.
6. When the cans are completely cooled, scoop the content onto the banana-filled crust.
